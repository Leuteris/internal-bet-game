				<p>
				<h6><u>
				Selection of the first 10 winners
				</u></h6>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The 10 winners will be those who have achieved the higher points at the end of the competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						The points system is as follows:
					</li>

					<li>
						Users select 1/X/2 in all matches (not the exact score).
					<ul>
						<li>
							If you miss the pick, you get 0 points.						</li>
						<li>
							If you make the pick, you get the "base points" multiplied by the "odds factor".							<ul>
								<li>
									What is "base points"? Base points = 100 for all Group Stage matches, 200 for all the rest of the matches except for the Final that gives 300.								</li>
								<li>
									What are the "odds factor"? It's the factor rewarding risky predictions vs safe ones? Example:									<ul>
										<li>
											Let's say England vs Italy gives 1.5 for "1", 2.5 for "X" and 3.5 for "2".											<ul>
												<li>
													If you've selected "1" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 1.5												</li>
												<li>
													If you've selected "X" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 2.5												</li>
												<li>
													If you've selected "2" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 3.5												</li>
												<li>
													Again: if you've guessed it wrong you get 0.												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Odds will be based on real ones from a betting house that will be communicated.								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Users will also select Over/ Under in all matches except for the Group Stage.						<ul>
							<li>
								This gives extra points ONLY if the 1/X/2 pick was correct							</li>
							<li>
								Extra points given by guessing right is: 0.5 * Base Points * "O/U odds factor"								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, from a betting house									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Note: All results are "90-min period" results (any overtime will be recorded as a tie = "X"); applies both on 1/X/2 and O/U					</li>
					<li>
						Most points win!					</li>

					<li>
						Winners will be announced upon the end of the competition via a slack message on the general channel and will also be notified individually.
					</li>
					<li>
						The winners have five (5) business days upon being notified to accept their prize (mail or slack notification suffices). If a winner does not accept their prize, then this will be awarded to the next in line entrant as per correct answers and time taken.  After the 5-day period, winner announcements will be final and binding on all matters relating to prize giveaways.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
				<h6><u>General

				<ul>
