					<h6><u>Registration
					</u></h6>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Registration requests will be submerged one of the guys in the Organisation committee. Users should bring 10 euros by Friday, June 8
						</li>
						<li>
							An emailing list with the participants will be created after the registration deadline
						</li>
						<li>
							Anyone can join; irrespective of whether he is based in Athens or not: ask to join via an email and we will find a way to sort out the logistics
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h6><u>
					Prizes
					</u></h6>
					Depends on the money pool.<br>
					In past events we were about 50-60 colleagues joining. Plan is to reward the ~TOP-4 with a scheme like 40 / 30 / 20 / 10 therefore normally, 1st winner would get around 200 euros.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h6><u>
					Game format
					</u></h6>
					<ul>
						<li>
							For the old dogs, it's the same format we had for Euro 2016. For the newcomers, please read scheme below
						</li>
						User selects 1/X/2 in all matches (not the exact score)
						<ul>
							<li>
								If you miss the pick, you get 0 points.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you make the pick, you get the "base points" multiplied by the "betting factor".
								<ul>
									<li>
										What is "base points"? Base points = 100 for all Group Stage matches, 200 for all the rest of the matches except for the Final that gives 300.
									</li>
									<li>
										What is the "betting factor"? It's the factor rewarding risky bets vs safe ones? Example:
										<ul>
											<li>
												Let's say England vs Italy gives 1.5 for "1", 2.5 for "X" and 3.5 for "2".
												<ul>
													<li>
														If you've selected "1" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 1.5
													</li>
													<li>
														If you've selected "X" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 2.5
													</li>
													<li>
														If you've selected "2" and you guessed it right you'll get Base Points * 3.5
													</li>
													<li>
														Again: if you've guessed it wrong you get 0.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										Betting factors will be based on real ones from a betting house that will be communicated. Yes, we are taking ourselves seriously.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							Users will also select Over/Under in all matches except for the Group Stage.
							<ul>
								<li>
									This gives extra points ONLY if the 1/X/2 pick was correct
								</li>
								<li>
									Extra points given by guessing right is: 0.5 * Base Points * "O/U betting factor"
									<ul>
										<li>
											Yes, from a betting house
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Note: All results are "90-min period" results (any overtime will be recorded as a tie = "X"); applies both on 1/x/2 and O/U
						</li>
						<li>
							Most points win!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h6><u>
					Phases
					</u></h6>
					Users will make picks in five (5) phases (therefore bets will be in chunks)
					<ul>
						<li>
							Group Stage. First match is on Thursday, June 14; you will be expected to provide your picks by Wednesday, June 13.
						</li>
						<li>
							Round of 16
						</li>
						<li>
							Quarter Finals
						</li>
						<li>
							Semi Finals
						</li>
						<li>
							Finals for 1st and 3rd position
						</li>
					</ul>
					All betting factors will be retrieved from bet365.com, updated on the latest data before each new phase begins, but will be locked in due time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h6><u>
					Terms
					</u></h6>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This is not a corporate event and it is not whatsoever related or affiliated with Upstream; it's an event among friends that happen to be colleagues
						</li>
						<li>
							There will be specific deadlines for placing your bets; in case you lose the date, you lose any opportunity to win points from that phase. There will be no exceptions whatsoever
						</li>
